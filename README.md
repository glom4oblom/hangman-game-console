# 🪓 Hangman Console Game (OOP)

This is my second student project in Python, demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It's a console-based Hangman game built as part of the JavaRush course.

The entire game logic is encapsulated within the `HangmanGame` class.

## 🚀 How to Run

1.  Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2.  Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3.  Run the game from your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
